An example script below. Notice the special way we extract the _manifest_.cix.xml file at the end.
This is beacause the EXPAND.EXE doesn't extract this file for whatever reason.

Lexicon
=======
IPD : Intra Package Delta. Also known as PA30 format.
MUM : Microsoft Update Manifest (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Update)
PA30 : See IPD.

1) MSU 10K feets structure
==========================
The MSU file is a ZIP file with 4 files in it.
*_PSFX.cab
*_PSFX.xml
*-pkgproperties_PSFX.txt
WSUSSCAN.cab

1.1) Package properties file
----------------------------
A small key=value file that summarize the target OSes and processor architecture, build date, KB article,
installer engine and other minor information.

1.2) PSFX.xml file
------------------
Largely useless. It references the PSFX.cab file and provides some minor information albeit perhaps a public
key token that is probably related to some kind of digital signature.

1.3) The .cab files
-------------------
These are special kind of CAB files using the IPD format. 7-zip doesn't support it, nor does some version of
the EXPAND utility. So we need a suitable version of EXPAND or a custom extraction tool.

2) WSUSSCAN cab file
====================
This file expands into two other cab files which in turn provide two similar trees with 3 sub-directories :
(core, extended, localized) and a package.xml file a couple of hundred Kbytes long.

The core and extended directories contain a couple thousand files numbered from 0 upward with no hole.
The localized directory is further divided in globalization related sub-directories which contain files
using the same numbering schemen albeit with some numbers missing. However, none of those files have a number
greater than any of the ones in the core and extended directories. This suggest some but not all of the
core/extended directory files require localization.

Finally all the files in the three directories are very small XML fragments : core -> <UpdateIdentity>,
extended -> <ExtendedProperties>, localized -> <LocalizedProperties>
Files content encoding is very likely of the UTF-8 kind.

For MSU files we dissected, file names in the PACKAGE and WSUSSCAN directories are matching 1 to 1, both at
filename and at content level. Hence only one of the directory needs to be processed.
